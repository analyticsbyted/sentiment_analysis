What's pity! -- another great product has been ruined. The change of the recipe and of the production place must be related to the dollar weakness relative to the euro."

The little 100-calorie packs of other sweets are a good choice for me, because they are just small, low-calorie packs of sweet things to eat. Here recently, I've gone to eating gluten-free and all-natural, so I don't really eat this type of food any more. I preface my review with that, so everyone is clear that this isn't my normal type of food when I am judging a rating on it, and my rating might be affected by the fact I usually don't eat processed foods. My daughter bought two boxes of these the other day--and cinnamon and brown sugar are two flavors I really love for the limited sweets I do eat--so she let me have one.<br /><br />They are very sweet. For me, they are too sweet... way too sweet. But for someone who likes sweets, I would imagine they are just the perfect amount of sweetness. What I really liked about them was the crispy, flakiness. They have this nice softish outer shell of pastry, but this nice, crisp, brittleness that makes them crunchy too. In flavor, they are like a thin, crispy pop tart. It's like all the good stuff of a pop tart without all the 'excess' pastry that pop tarts have that I don't like. I love the crispness.<br /><br />My BFF tried the chocolate ones and said it was very good and didn't have any powder 'fake' chocolate taste that some chocolate products have. She liked the crispiness of it too.<br /><br />So if you're a sweets eater, these small little pop-tart-like treats are probably going to be the perfect little snack item and if you can bring yourself to eat only one package of them (there are two small 'sticks' or 'bars' in each interior package), then it's only 100-calories and might fit in well with a low-calorie and/or low-fat diet plans too. They are not, however, good for low-carbing or Paleo or all-natural diets. For older kids and teenagers, they are probably a great slightly healthier substitution for pop tarts too."

Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area's gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself ""home of silk and tea"" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name ""gunpowder"" derives from the tea's elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream."

This little can, however, packed some big taste!<br /><br />First Impressions: I must admit, I was disappointed in the size of the container. Sure, it's slender and can fit on shelves easier, but in the end, it means less juice. I read about the promise of 100% juice and 0% added sugars and preservatives. I knew the only way to properly test this out was to crack open the can.<br /><br />Appearance and Nutrition:  This can is identical to the size of a Red Bull, giving us about 8.3 ounces to drink, roughly 4 less than a standard soda can.<br />The nutritional facts tell us that each one of these little cans packs 135 calories. There's sodium and a pretty high carbohydrate count of 34 grams - plus 33 grams of sugar (that's regular, not added). It does have 100% vitamin C, so there's a plus.<br /><br />Taste: This is a sweet, fruity drink. The sweetness is natural, not artificial, which is a very nice change of pace for those who want to kick soda to the curb. It has the right blend of kiwi, raspberry, strawberry, apple and grape juices - no one overpowers the other. If a drink has a high carbonation level I usually hiccup, but that didn't happen here.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: While the taste is good, I'm not ready to ""make the switch"" for two main reasons:<br />(1) The small can size.<br />(2) The large calorie count.<br /><br />For a quick burst of fruity goodness, this is a good choice. However, if you want more drink with fewer calories, I'd suggest a 1-liter bottle of Clear Splash water, which retails for about the same price."

If you like one, maybe you will like the other.<br /><br />Regarding coffee, I like strong and smooth.  I don't like French roast as I find it too harsh, but I do like Italian roast.  Kona is great and I like Hazelnut, Vanilla and Chocolate flavors.<br />I drink my coffee with probably too much (at least 2-3 creamer containers worth to a 12 oz cup coffee) of evaporated milk in it or plain non-dairy creamer. No sugar.<br /><br />That being said...my favorite coffees are:<br /><br />Green Mountain Hazelnut Dark Roast Extra Bold<br />Emeril's Big Easy Bold Coffee<br />Newman's Own Extra Bold<br />Tully's Coffee Kona Blend Extra Bold<br />Folger's Gourmet Vanilla Biscotti<br /><br />and a special mention for<br />Timothy's World Coffee German Chocolate Cake - It has an almost coco-nutty taste to it. Not the deep chocolate taste I was looking for, but the best I have found so far. Please if you can suggest a Dark Chocolate Flavor coffee to me; do so.<br /><br />Also since I have posted a review about a Senseo coffee and now clearly have switched to Keurig a bit about why... if you're interested..which why I put it last.  Feel free to ignore it.<br /><br />We decided to get a Keurig coffee maker after enjoying the Senseo system for over 3 years.<br />Please note, since we got the Senseo system essentially free, not much thought was put into it's purchase. However it did introduce us to single serving coffee systems.<br /><br />We switched to the Keurig system from the Senseo for several reasons.<br /><br />1. Local availability of coffee. For some reason the Senseo system was waning here at the Rochester NY grocery stores and what good is a coffee maker without coffee?  Yes, you can buy online, but sometimes when your planning isn't the best, you might run out. What coffee they did carry was limited and not our preferences.<br /><br />2. Online purchases of Senseo coffees  were either for 4 bags of 16-18 of one variety or 4 bags of a mix of coffees. Invariably there was a few you didn't like.  I never saw small quantities of 5 or so.<br /><br />3. The Senseo ""duck"" for filling  with your own coffee never worked for us.  I'm an engineer and my boyfriend is an inspector. We literally did controlled experiments to get this to work and never could. Maybe we had a faulty unit, but based on reviews here, we were in good company. I knew many that had luck with the Keurig system however and we did as well.<br /><br />4. Once you open a bag of Senseo pods, they are starting to go stale, by virtue of being open to air. The Keurig system's coffees remain sealed and you can have many flavors ""open"" at once. Yes for those of you that are ""green"" there is more plastic waste. However I'm being selfish here and am being more concerned with the green in my pocket and fresh coffee."

The vet prescribed everything under the sun, antibiotics, special shampoos, special dog food, including a certain amount of sunlight daily. After months of testing, meds and specialties, including cooking her special diet,with nothing working,I decided to try a different approach and came across this dog food. Within a few weeks her itching had completely stopped, and her coat was growing back like silk. They liked every type of the sweet potato and chicken, fish, duck. With the fish and chicken being their favorite. No nasty food smells as others have reported. Have also purchased the same in the biscuits and they love those also, which surprised me. Have used the meat rolls in the duck and beef, loved those also. So this is the new way of life for us now. And when you break down the price for the larger bag as opposed to the Pedigree, etc, it comes out pretty good price wise. The vet bill alone was killing me anyway.

Some folks in the reviews almost acted as if these noodles were sent from God.  I've eaten Ramen Noodles for quite some time and have found them to be a super inexpensive meal at .10 a package and sometimes cheaper.  I also like other readers mentioned don't always use the entire seasoning packet because of the high sodium content.  I found these noodles to have even higher sodium content.  Which I guess isn't too bad if you don't plan on eating the soup.<br />These noodles to me tasted just about the same as Ramen Noodles except the noodles were a tid bit larger in size.  If we are reviewing just the flavor packet, I would say it was pretty good.  Especially for those who like spice like myself.  I am use to eating super spicy foods and have a high tolerance to spice.  So they were right on par with what I am use to as far as the heat goes.  But I can see someone who doesn't eat spicy foods to find the seasoning super hot and spicy for them.  I like the idea of the dehydrated veggies that are enclosed to accompany the seasoning.  I am giving these noodles 3 stars because they are just overpriced Ramen in my opinion.  Plus the sodium content in the noodles is just unacceptable.  They surely can come up with lower sodium options. And lastly I give it 3 stars because of the price.  I would not expect to pay more than .50 cents a package for these noodles in a retail store.

There are 2 kinds of chips that have a nice sweet taste that go good together. The main issue I found is the claim it is gooey. I think that's an overstatement. While there is a small amount of fudge goo in the middle, it doesn't make the whole cookie gooey. If anything, a moderate sensation of gooeyness is produced once you chew the entire cookie in your mouth, but it's nowhere near, say, a chocolate fudge brownie.

It is hard to believe I am now able to enjoy such a treat as this with almost zero carbs and very few calories.<br /><br />The key to getting rid of the extra moisture associated with these noodles is to ""Roast"" them in a dry pan before using for a recipe or adding sauce.

I wish they  had this posted on the package, I think more people would enjoy them if they take the time to do this very important step.<br /><br />I roast the noodles by placing in a dry hot frying pan and ""stir fry"" them until all the steam evaporates from the noodles.

My favorite aspect of it, though, is that it dissolves really well.  I have tried powdered drink mixes, and there are always a few grains on the side or bottom of the glass, but this drink is a liquid.  If you put it in the glass before adding water, you don't even need to stir.  No gross residue on the glass, and no gross residue on your teeth.  The next time I'm in the mood for a flavoring for water, this is definitely the product I will choose.<br /><br />(I should note that I have only tried the Mango Peach flavor, which doesn't exactly taste like real fruit but is still sweet and invigorating.  Some of the other available flavors may be more to your preference, but I tried to focus my main review on the characteristics of the product that I suspect are common to all of the flavors.)"

We bought ours at Costco which came with 1-130L Co2 Carbonator, 2 1-Liter Stainless Steel Bottles and trial flavors pack for $99. First let me say I'm very pleased, the flavors are not bad at all and i can use my own filtered water from either the fridge or Pure faucet attachment and no longer need to pay or bring back bottles for the deposit. They also have much less sodium than store bought soda with the exception of Diet Rite.<br /><br /> I have tried many diet flavors and the ones i like the best are Orange, Caffeine free cola, dr pete, Fountain Mist, Cream Soda and Root Beer. As for the cost it has changed everything, no longer have to pay deposit, return empties or search for sale price on soda which means lot less trips to the store saving me from impulse buying and gasoline usage. I can now make fresh bottles of soda whenever I need it (unlike store bought soda which can lose carbonation)  and any flavor I feel like at the time. Already used up  1- 130L Co2  carbonator bottle so ordered 1 full bottle + 1 exchange for empty bottle from SodaStream web site this way I'll always have one full bottle when one is done. You should always search the web for coupons for any online store before ordering and SodaStream is no exception, saved $15 which is the price of the license on a new bottle.  So it cost me the same as if ordering to exchange 130L Co2 Carbonators, pretty sweet. If you order 10 bottles of syrup at a time you get one free  and with on line coupons and cashing in points your earn from them with every purchase can save you more than just the shipping cost, the cost of a trip to the store. For me the SodaStream is well worth the cost."

The strawberry is bright and present, adding a hint of sweetness. The taste combined almost reminds me on when I eat strawberries too fast and I accidentally eat the stem or a leaf, which happens often haha!<br /><br />Now my favorite part, making this matcha into an iced strawberry soy latte! I did about ¾ or 2/3 cup of light soy milk (ran out of milk), bit of sweetener, 1/4tsp of matcha and whisked it. The result: very tasty strawberry balanced with the taste of matcha. Even better than strawberry soy milk as it tastes just like strawberry candy. An amazing treat for under 90 calories!<br /><br />Overall, very delicious if you are into the strawberry candy flavor.

The flavors that came in this six flavor variety package were Original, Barbeque, Cheddar, Salt & Pepper, Sea Salt & Vinegar, and Sour Cream & Onion. Although I tried all the flavors, the last three mentioned flavors have dominated my taste buds to create the impression that Pop Chips is mostly of salty or bitter flavors. The Original flavor was okay, gives you an idea of what the original Pop Chips is supposed to taste like. It's cool that it's not baked or fried so it's healthy. When I think Barbeque flavor, I immediately think of Lay's Barbeque Potato Chips. If you can't match or surpass Lay's Barbeque flavor you fail, and Pop Chips fails. You can taste the barbeque flavor but it is very subtle. The same goes for the Cheddar flavor; the cheddar flavor is very subtle. I like the cheddar heavy on please. I'm guessing Pop Chips is trying to make healthy chips so additional flavorings like barbeque and cheddar are moderately laid on. As for the remaining rest (Salt & Pepper and Sea Salt & Vinegar), they're not very tasty and somewhat bitter to boot. If you like bitter than those flavors are for you. I prefer sweet flavors. My mom tried an unfinished bag of Salt & Pepper that I had laid on the table one day and later told me the chips were not very good and to not buy them again. Sour Cream & Onion I like when I'm really hungry or in the mood for sourness and have sweet liquid around to neutralize the sour. When I first received this package, I had touted to my mom about all the good reviews. Needless to say I was disappointed after I tried these chips out. I don't think I would buy these chips again unless I was seeking to eat a little more healthier."

Marshall ""Ann S.""",0,0,5,1329523200,Tasty food for a picky cat,"Our beloved Bengal kitty, Isabel, is 13 years old and suffering from kidney stones, which are inoperable in felines. For years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health declined. Our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she'd eat: ""She might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years.""<br /><br />So, we offered her one soft food after another. She turned up her nose at the expensive, vet-sold brands and repeatedly rejected one national brand and flavor after another. Finally, to her gustatory delight (and our great relief), she made her choice: this particular Wiskas version is the ONLY kind she'll eat day in and day out. It MUST be Whiskas with the turkey AND GIBLETS in GRAVY. The gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she can't resist.<br /><br />We surmise that, like humans, our pets have food preferences linked to palate-pleasing aroma and taste. This Whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our Izzy. No, it's not the best choice for managing kidney stones, but she's got to eat. (So you won't worry that we're ignoring her renal problems, she's on daily medication and is doing quite well.)<br /><br />It's not an inexpensive cat food, but its packaging is very convenient and space-saving. The Amazon auto-ship program is a life saver. The cartons always arrive on time, and the per-package bulk rate is lower than the price of small quanities. Also, our local Target was the only place we could find this exact variety, and now the store no longer carries it. (Remember, our cat demands GIBLETS and GRAVY and accepts no substitutes).<br /><br />Give autoship a try. The price is better, and you can easily adjust the quantity and frequency of shipment or cancel altogether."

However, I found them not exceptionally good, and not a better value than some of the Senseo ones.<br /><br />The coffee itself it OK. It's not too bitter, and not too light. However it leaves a sour aftertaste. It's organic, which means, it's not from an acidic preservative they add, but probably the coffee itself contains this sourness.<br /><br />And also the pod size is interesting. They seem to be 1.5 the size of the other pods I have, and it difficult to have the right amount of water. The  (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QTVS5K"">Senseo machine I have</a>) has two options, single pod (8 oz), or double (16 oz). Neither fits these pods well. I compensate the difference by changing the amount of cream I use, but it would be better to have the right amount in the first place.<br /><br />While it's better than some Senseo pods, like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001ES9FI"">Senseo Dark Roast</a> -- which I find ""burnt"", and bitter, it's still inferior to many others (for example <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XZMD2G"">Senseo Kona Pack of 4</a>. And the 4 pack offers better value per pod (even if I use double in a single cup), so there is little reason to prefer these over what I'm already used to at the moment.<br /><br />Unfortunately experimenting with these coffee did not end well. They are not better tasting than regular Senseo pods, they have a bitter after taste, the size is not right, and the price per pod is not as cost effective. It still is OK coffee, so I'm rating them 3/5 stars."

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

Naturally, Lipton offers tea flavors.<br /><br />The instructions say to add one full packet to 16 oz. of water, but I used twice the water it recommended for one packet, and it's still very flavorable and super-sweet.  If you're going to use a glass of water or small bottle of water, I'd recommend trying only half a packet (or less) to start.  There are honey granules (sugar and honey) that dissolve and sweeten the water.  The packaging touts that there's no aspartame (Equal) in these like Crystal Light, but there is sucralose listed as an ingredient, which is another artificial sweetener.<br /><br />Most importantly, though, is that these new Lipton packets, like Crystal Light packets, give your water a little boost of flavor and, in the case of green tea, flavonoids.  If you're trying to eliminate sodas from your diet and are tired of drinking ""just"" water, try these little packets.  You'll still be drinking the water, but you'll have a flavor boost that won't make you feel like you're drinking ""just"" water."

I was just looking for some different sort of energy drink. Before lunch a few days later at work, I was exhausted, to the point of basically falling asleep in my chair. I drank this along with my lunch without thinking about it. That was around 12:30 PM. When four o' clock hit, I suddenly realized I had gone almost four hours since having lunch and still felt very energized. Now, while my normal lunch (with a Gatorade or soda) will energize me, its effects last a maximum of an hour. So without even thinking about the fact that I was drinking an energy drink (the packaging does not really look like an energy drink, after all), I completely felt its effects for hours. I'm fairly certain this is not just some placebo effect, either.<br /><br />Oh, it also tastes nice, nothing like your typical energy drink.

I purchased a single bag to try, and I'm so glad I did!  Generally most of the gluten free flours have very little nutritional value.  I know this is true of regular all-purpose flour as well, but considering I can't have regular multi-grain/whole-grain things I figured that if I could find a gluten free flour with extra nutrition in it, it couldn't hurt.  Generally I've used this in a ratio of 1:2 or 2:1 with regular gluten free all purpose flour; I've never tried using it just on it's own based on the reviews here.  I've been very pleasantly surprised.  It's helped the regular flour retain more moisture in cooking so I haven't had to rely on adding much xantham gum.  I haven't been able to taste the beans or an aftertaste at all.  It might be due to the mixing with other flour, the amount of spice I use in my baked goods, or I just have tastebuds that don't notice or don't mind.  My husband is pretty picky though and he's eaten baked goods using this and hasn't mentioned anything about a bean flavor.

He eats his prescription dry in the morning and this at night.  Normally he's content to let the other two cats get to their food first and hold back with patience for his own, but with this it is the first time I have seen him muscle away the other two cats to eat.  I'll be sticking with this and the turkey flavor.<br /><br />Also there is no fish in this or the turkey flavor wet or dry foods which is excellent!  My cats don't tend to enjoy food that has fish in it and this is one of the few foods I can find that is both good for them and has no fish.  One of them does not like the peas in the food, he will eat around them, but one of the others eats them when he's done.  So if your cat hates bits of veggies they may not really enjoy it as much.<br /><br />Oh and one more point, it doesn't have that funky wet food smell a lot of other foods (even good ones) have.

We have found our life is slightly (ok that is an understatement--ha ha) more complicated now that our daughter is a toddler and so we seem to always be in a bit of a rush.<br /><br />We were all packed into the car when I asked my husband if he brought gum (I wanted to make sure my breath was nice and fresh and I also wanted something to chew during the 1 hour drive). He did not remember to bring it, and so I had him rush back into the house and get it. I had not specified which flavor (we had a mulipack of Artic Chill, Spearmint, and Peppermint that we just bought that week to try) so he just grabbed one pack from the 3 choices.<br /><br />I did not take the time to see what flavor, and just popped 2 pieces into my mouth. I almost spit it completely out! The Artic Chill was so very VERY strong! I would describe it as Listerine flavored.<br /><br />My husband tried the gum after me, and was happy/grateful that I warned him about the extreme intensity. I would have to say that this Artic Chill flavor was my least favorite flavor. I think it should be saved for when you need to blast away offensive breath or when you are seriously worried or concerned that you will have bad breath around someone. After the initial first 10-15 minute shock of the full strength was over, I was able to enjoy this gum and my mouth felt really fresh.<br /><br />I do want to mention though, that I timed the flavor strength and it was a good 10 minutes of full blast flavor, the kind that could knock you over. If I previously had any foul or even ""not freshly brushed"" breath before trying this, it was certainly gone after chewing this! The flavor eventually went back to a normal minty strength within about 15 minutes and the overall flavor lasted about 30 minutes (right about the time when you want to remove gum as it begins to get harder to chew and more bland)."

I've also tried three other chais from Celestial, Bigelow and Gloria Jean's and had the same reaction to them all during my side by side taste test.

I find it quite tasty. I've tried Red Bull, Guru, White Lightening, and Blue Sky so far (only the ones that come in an 8 oz can). All the drinks give me a caffeine kick and work similarly for me, so I have to go with taste. And how nauseated the drink makes me. For Hansen's Energy Pro, it's not at all nauseated. And when I look at my fridge full of little energy drink cans at 4am, this is the one I want to reach for the most, having tried them all. The next in line has been the two Blue Sky products, which are worth checking out, but much more flavored tasting, which is not necessarily good.<br /><br />The flavor is very mild. It's sort of like squirt or another sweet lemon lime soda. And it's not very carbonated. It's almost flat. But for some reason, that seems more natural. Natural as a descriptor is pretty meaningless. I don't mind buying energy drinks that market themselves with that theme, despite it probably being self-delusion that any energy drink sold in a little can could be from nature.<br /><br />Anyway, I had to order it from an Amazon vendor (when I order almost everything from Amazon using Prime) and it took forever to get it. Unfortunately, since I like this product a lot, I'll probably have to order it and wait and pay shipping again.

I'm working at the office one day several years ago when a co-worker pulls out a tub of Gustaf's and tells me to try a licorice coin.  Now, I hate licorice.  Always have.  But I decided to humor him.  Within 5 seconds that candy was out of my mouth and into the nearest trash can.  He assured me that his initial response to the candy was similar, but that several weeks later he began to crave their curious flavor.<br /><br />It took a bit longer for me to come around, but it's true.  There is definitely something about this candy that I love.  It's not your traditional candy.  There's nothing ""sweet"" about it.  It's like a salt-lick for humans, tapping into that part of our primal instinct that craves a salty flavor every now and then.<br /><br />The initial insertion of the candy is a shock, like a weird chemical burn on your tongue that you want absolutely no part of!  Wait it out.  Suck on one of the coins for a while.  Put it in between your teeth and squeeze out the salty, licorice flavor.  It's different than regular licorice, whose flavor is only really apparent towards then end of the candy when you've sucked all the saltiness from it.<br /><br />Take your time with a piece and give it a shot. It's an acquired taste; like coffee or beer, and it's definitely not for everyone.  And it's not one of those candies that you just want to keep in a jar on your desk year round.

Easy to open package, the cookies were setting carefully inside compartments to avoid excessive bumps with other cookies. Containing blended pieces of chocolate chips, the chocolate dough was well flavored, and the cookies were chewy, easy on the teeth, and quite tasty. Just a nice chocolatey experience for all ages.<br /><br />Aside from a little bit of a strong aftertaste, the flavor was solid and appealing. The aftertaste was less pleasant and reminded me a little of generic, artificial flavoring used in most processed foods of today. Although not excessive, there were many crumbs left from the cookies and each one needed gentle handling to avoid falling apart. This quality likely allows for the soft, chewy feeling but has the potential to be a crumbly mess if the eater is not careful.<br /><br />Good price, good eating, and lots of fun, this is highly recommended for a quick, comfortable dessert. Maybe the overall flavor and approach is more appealing to a younger generation than older although the soft idea is appropriate for all ages.

One is 12 years old now she won't chew on toys, rawhides or bones of any sort. It was no big surprise that she wouldn't touch it. My other Chihuahua is only 2 years old and will chew on almost any type of rawhide or bone. Over the long 4th of July weekend she was driving us crazy because she wouldn't stop barking and growling at all the fireworks. She is scared to death of fireworks and will shake like crazy and go nuts. So I decided to give her one of these to keep her busy for a while.<br /><br />She loved it and wouldn't put it down for nearly 5 hours. She pretty much ignored the fireworks for the rest of the night and went to town on devouring the MiniCongo. Occasionally she would decide to take a break and walk away but she wouldn't take her eye off it. If I would walk near it or our other dog would approach it then she would pounce on it and guard it with her life. She seemed to really love the peanut butter filling inside because she kept trying to lick inside before chewing the beefhide.<br /><br />About a month ago we gave her a Purina Busy Bone which is similar to this and she loved it as well. It has filling in the middle too. The difference is the Busy Bone really upset her stomach for 24 hours or so and the MiniCongo didn't.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by Mini in the name because these are still quite large. It is probably too big for our Chihuahua but that didn't stop her. I am happy to give these to my dog because they do a good job of cleaning their teeth. The more chewing they do now, the better their dental health will be when they get older."

That said, this is a very good coffee and is likely superior to the gourmet coffees that have been sitting on the shelf in a typical supermarket.  It's well rounded, neither too acidic nor bland for my tastes, and I look forward to the couple cups I start my day with.  Note that last qualification; it's extremely important.<br /><br />In the vast scheme of things, five pounds of coffee is not a lot.  I'm fairly certain that there are many places the world over where more coffee has accumulated.  Even my child weighed more than five pounds at birth, and I'm grateful for that.  However five pounds of coffee delivered to my house is more coffee than has ever gathered there, and if it were five pounds of bad coffee... well, that's kind of a serious situation to have on one's hands.<br /><br />Thankfully the coffee is pretty good and in the nearly three months it's taken me to work my way through it I've had no regrets.

I took a chance on this brand because of an Amazon promotion, but I don't think I'll be buying any more.<br /><br />Like another reviewer, I knew I was in trouble when I opened the bag.  Characteristic of the beans that I've enjoyed the most is a rich, oily sheen left on the beans from the roasting process.  These aromatic oils are filled with flavor and provide a richness to your brew.  This bag?  The beans looked dry and oil-free.  I confirmed this when I put it through my grinder.  The grinds didn't stick to the grinder and the lid because there were no oils to bind it.  A disappointment!<br /><br />I thought to myself though, that the proof is in the taste.  So I brewed a pot and confirmed my suspicion; the coffee lacked depth and really tasted like coffee flavored water.  Now in case you think that my wife and I like our brews dark and strong, that's not the case.  We're both in preference to roasts on the light-medium end of the scale.  But this is an entirely different animal -- the flavor is just....off.<br /><br />If you're purchasing from Amazon, consider <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SJHO4M"">Kicking Horse Coffee Z-Wrangler Medium, Whole Bean Coffee, 12.3-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a> instead.

The beans are characteristically oily with a beautiful, chocolate sheen. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Z613JO"">Magnum Kona Blend Coffee, Whole Bean, 1 Lb Bag</a> is another that I can heartily recommend (though I prefer the Kicking Horse just a tad bit more).<br /><br />Yes, it's more costly, but really, it's a small luxury in this frugal era of ""staycations"" and still cheaper than buying Starbucks or DD every day.

I also feel better giving these to my dog as frequently as necessary in training because he is not getting alot of additional ingredients such as grains. I highly recommend these treats.

Because there's only one cookie inside each unit, the proportions are pretty gross - you get the medium firm texture of the outer chocolate layer, which is fine, but a single interior cookie is not enough crunch to set off the sort of lardy faux-peanut-butter layer. My son (age 10) ate a bunch and probably would have eaten more, but I'm more of a discerning customer when it comes to both chocolate and peanut butter, so I stopped after my 2 experimental ones. I do like plain Oreos, and the plain Oreos covered in the 'fudge' - but this combo just doesn't do it for me. It seems like it's just a typical processed sweet snack food with no real flavor."

Just heaven really. I loved the lemon zest too. It wasn't sour but gave a nice little essence like an implied ""zing"" that was different but unoffensive and made the smell of the bar just delightful. The peppercorn felt like a party crasher. They're pretty little pink pearls, but they're still pepper. It's like meeting someone beautiful with a mean personality. It didn't compliment anything and instead clashed with the other tastes. They're sprinkled throughout the bar. You won't get one in every nibble, and in those cases that subtle pepper taste is tolerable. However you will get whole peppercorns and it's kind of overpowering. As delicious as the first two components of the bar are, I'm not sure I'd buy another one. I know the aim of this company is to be a little different but pepper coupled with white chocolate just wasn't the way to go."

I typically make all my son's food but even with glass jars with lids its a little messy to tote my homemade stuff when we are out and about. I saw these at Target one day and decided to try them. I LOVE this stuff now :) I love the fact that it's all natural and the packaging is free of any of the gooky stuff I don't want to put in my kid. When we are out, I don't even take a spoon. My son just sucks it straight out of the package. He is breast fed and occasionally bottle fed and he had no trouble figuring out how to suck these out of the package right away.<br /><br />The flavors I've seen are all mostly fruits with some veggies snuck in. This one tastes mostly like apples (yes, I did taste it :) I taste all my son's food). I would like to see some more flavors that also taste of veggies so they don't get too stuck on the sweet stuff.<br /><br />I also like the fact that if he doesn't finish all of this in one sitting, I can put the cap back on and save it for later. One negative is that on some of the packages I found that the first little bit that comes out is a little nasty looking. The rest of the package looks good and my son has not had a negative reaction. I usually just squeeze that bit out first and let him eat it from there.<br /><br />The price here on amazon is the best I've seen. With subscribe and save I'm averaging $1 or less per package compared to in stores where they average about $1.50 per package.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone, whether you make your own food for your baby or consistently purchase baby food. It's a winner."

They taste a bit like a very chewy, very sweet Rice Krispie / oat bar.  The amount of almonds (nice that they are whole) was a bit sparse and the cranberries are sort of ground up - not so much like actual trail mix.  The amount of goodies in the bar does not really match the picture on the box, which shows many more almonds, cranberries and raisins than I actually found to be in the product (based on my eating 3 bars out of the package so far).  The bars are convenient to take ""on the go"".<br /><br />However, in my opinion, this product is masquerading as a ""healthy"" trail mix bar and should be considered more like a cookie or candy bar.  It has 14 grams of sugars per bar, which is 40% by weight, as another reviewer pointed out, and it is SWEET.  It also only has 1 gram of fiber per bar, so it is not so healthy in that respect.  That said, I still rate the NV Chewy Trail Mix Bars as 5 stars for the good taste, but I personally would choose a healthier product (with less sugar and higher fiber) for everyday eating or if I were actually bringing this on a hiking trip.<br /><br />The product I received has a slightly different list of ingredients than listed on the Amazon site at this time and has likely been reformulated to avoid the use of high fructose corn syrup, which has been under scrutiny lately.  This product contains high maltose corn syrup instead.<br /><br />List of ingredients from the box I received:<br />Whole Grain Oats, High Maltose Corn Syrup, Crisp Rice (Rice Flour, Sugar, Malt Extract, Salt), Sugar, Raisins, Almonds, Honey, Roasted Peanuts, Fructose, Sunflower Seed, Canola Oil.
